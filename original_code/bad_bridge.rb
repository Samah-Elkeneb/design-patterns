# Our app sends notifications. Right now, all types (email, SMS, push) are in one class with many if/else.
# This makes it hard to add new notification types or sending methods.

# Task

# Refactor the notification system using Bridge Pattern.

# Separate notification type (abstraction) from sending method (implementation).

# Add at least 3 sending methods (Email, SMS, Push).

# Make it easy to add new types or methods without changing existing code.

# No if/else in the main notification logic.
